## Core Operational Principles

1. **Deterministic & Auditable Workflows:** Every parameter, threshold, and scoring rule must be grounded in observable telemetry rather than intuition.
2. **Regional Compliance & Localization:** Full adherence to GCC (Saudi GAMR, ZATCA, SAMA) and Egypt regulatory frameworks for e-commerce and digital communications.
3. **Fail-Safe Operational Guardrails:** Built-in safeguards against runaway ad spend, deliverability burn, or unmonitored lead SLA breaches.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Baseline Audit & Configuration
- Review current infrastructure parameters against the recommended baseline targets.
- Validate environment configuration and verify that regional formatting rules are in place.

### Step 2: Deployment & Validation Run
- Execute initial dry-run using representative sample datasets.
- Confirm output metrics and telemetry align with acceptable error thresholds (&lt; 2%).

### Step 3: Routine Monitoring & Quality Governance
- Establish weekly reconciliation cadences between platform reporting and internal source-of-truth databases.
- Log anomalies and update exclusion filters periodically.
